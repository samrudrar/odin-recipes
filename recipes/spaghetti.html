        <h4>Assassin's Spaghetti:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons red chili flakes, or to taste</li>
            <li>6 ounces dry spaghetti</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley, for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions:</h2>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li><br>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a pot over medium heat.<br>
                Add garlic and sizzle until it starts to turn golden and<br>
                fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in tomato puree, water, and salt.<br> 
                Bring to a simmer on medium-high. Once simmering, reduce to<br>
                low heat and keep warm.</li><br>
            <li>Pour olive oil into a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat,<br>
                season with chili flakes and heat until chili flakes start to sizzle,<br>
                for 1 minute. Add raw spaghetti and toss until well coated with chili oil.</li><br>
            <li>Pour in about 3 cups of tomato broth and, using tongs, move pasta<br>
                from side to side to evenly distribute tomato broth. Cook, <br>
                occasionally moving pasta from side to side with tongs, all facing <br>
                the same direction, until most of the broth has been absorbed or evaporated,<br>
                and the spaghetti starts frying in the pan.</li><br>
            <li>Turn spaghetti over with tongs, and evenly arrange in the pan.<br>
                Keep cooking until the pasta starts to brown, and even lightly chars.</li><br>
            <li>Add about 2 more cups of tomato broth, and repeat the process.<br>
                Continue cooking until the spaghetti is as charred as you like ,<br>
                and cooked to your desired doneness. More broth can be added at the<br>
                end of the process for a saucier version, as shown in the video,<br>
                or it can be served relatively dry.</li><br>
            <li>Serve with a drizzle of olive oil and more chili flakes if desired.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
